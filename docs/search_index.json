Although many systems are cheaper than the traditional infrared locomotor activity monitors (e.g., DAM/LAM), these options can remain complicated to build, computationally intensive to setup/process, and/or unable to accommodate large-bodied insects (i.e., not Drosophila). To fill this gap, we developed the affordable, imaging Locomotor Activity Monitor (iLAM) for activity quantification. The iLAM utilizes a Raspberry Pi Zero W computer and night-vision camera inside a flight cage to regularly photograph a population of insects at user-defined intervals. Customizable, modular R-scripts process consecutive images with imager and output a file containing the number, size, location, and timing of all identified movements. Movement data can be converted into DAM format or directly analyzed within the Rethomics framework. Out-of-the-box functions can be downloaded and installed from our iLAMtools R package by: library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&quot;iLAMtools/iLAMtools&quot;, force=TRUE) library(iLAMtools) Figure 1.1: iLAM Workflow Figure 1.2: Representative firefly movements identified by iLAM system This resource provides detailed instructions for (1) iLAM construction, (2) Raspberry Pi setup, (3) Image analysis in R, (4) conversion of iLAM output to DAM format in R, and (5) Sample results using Rethomics.

Add static IP address for remote access: https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/set-up-static-ip-address 5. Continue programming directly or remotely access the Pi through terminal from another PC: ssh login_name@[IP address] password: 6. Make a folder/directory named ‘still’ to hold images: mkdir still_[xxx] Note: [xxx] refers to the login name of the Raspberry Pi associated with the iLAM 7. Make a directory named script to hold scripts: mkdir script_[xxx] 8. Write a script using a text-editor (e.g., nano) named still_[xxx].sh: sudo nano ./script_[xxx]/still_[xxx].sh and write the following text: #!/bin/bash DATE=$(date +&quot;%m%d.%H%M&quot;) sudo raspistill -o /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg This script will take images and save them along w/ metadata into the still_$USER directory: (Line 1) necessary for any bash file with instructions (Line 2) sets the format for the date and time in the file name (Line 3) command for pi to take a photo and store it with specified file name/location. Hit control^X to exit (type y when asked if you want to save) 9. To automatically upload/copy images into a remote directory, you may (A) use scp to upload each image after it’s taken, or (b) mount a remote directory and then copy each image. ssh-keygen and ENTER to generate a new SSH key to enable a custom script to automatically upload images without requiring a password input ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa [remote_PC_hostname]@[remote_PC IP address] Input password for remote_PC Option A: Add the following line to the end of still_[xxx].sh: scp /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg [remote_PC_hostname]@[remote_PC IP address]:[directory that you want images saved into]/ Option B: Add the following lines to the end of still_[xxx].sh: sleep 10 scp /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg /home/$USER/mount_$USER/ 10.

Access Raspberry Pi image files on your PC: Even if your iLAM/Pi is programmed to upload files to a remote computer over Wifi, at the end of every experiment, we recommend verifying that all images were properly uploaded/transferred. To remotely download images, you may: Option A: Download images via Command line Log in to the Linux/Powershell on your laptop scp pi@[IP address]:~/still_[xxx]/*.jpg ~/[target directory]` Option B: Download images via a free file transfer program (FTP) like FileZilla Open FileZilla: In Site Manager, choose New site Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol Host: [IP Address of Raspberry Pi] Logon Type: Normal User: [Pi login name] Password: [Pi login password] Connect Trouble-shooting -raspistill will not take a picture and returns** *failed to open vchiq instance: Verify that the camera is connected and the ribbon cable is not damaged: vcgencmd get_camera Determine if the camera or the still_[xxx].sh script is the issue: raspistill -o /home/$USER/test.jpg Modify permissions of the camera: sudo chmod777 /dev/vchiq A Linux reader is required to read the Raspian imaged SD card, when plugged into a Windows PC.

(default: n_cln = 5, n_grw = 1.5) Note: For moths (O. nubilalis, H. zea, S. frugiperda), we use: n_cln=10, n_grw=1.5 Note: For beetles (Photinus species, H. axyridus), we use: n_cln=10, n_grw=1.5 genus: Character string for study organism species: Character string for study organism color: Character string to indicate whether the study organism appears “white” or “black” on the background Note: For moths (O. nubilalis, H. zea, S. frugiperda), we use: “white” Note: For beetles (Photinus species), we use: “black” For more information on threshold, clean, blur, etc., see imager documentation for more details. pi_sub_folder &lt;- &quot;ilam01&quot; sex &lt;- &quot;male&quot; #cage/project-specific #Crop-settings x_left &lt;- 425 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement x_right &lt;- 2225 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement y_bot &lt;- 100 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement y_top &lt;- 1700 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement #change following values for every experiment out_file_name = &quot;iLAM_exp_a&quot; #project-specific n_thr = 0.999 #species-specific, depending on IR reflectance/contrast with background n_cln = 10 #species-specific, depending on IR reflectance n_max = 75000 #species-specific, pixel differences above this value will be considered as noise start_photophase = 5 #project-specific, time that lights turn on end_photophase = 21 #project-specific, time that dark starts genus = &quot;photinus&quot; #project-specific species = &quot;marginellus&quot; #project-specific animal = &quot;black&quot; #project-specific, during the night, does the animal appear &quot;white&quot; on a dark background or &quot;black&quot; on a light background?

For example, when n_cln=5 and n_grw = 1.5, blobs are first shrunk by 5 pixels and then grown by 5x1.5=7.5 pixels (default: n_grw = 1.5) n_max: Integer value denoting the maximum number of pixel differences expected between two images; any values above this n_max will be considered as noisy and assigned an arbitrary value for subsequent filtering/removal. See @ref(04-make_dam_output.Rmd) for more information. Example, if a moth movement = 3000 pixels and there are five moths in a cage, then the maximum number of differences expected is 15,000 pixels.

If this issue continues, then remove any days at the experiment end where all/most insects have died; this can downwardly bias the average number of pixel differences expected across images.

Program iLAMs Modify crontab file Delete old images to free storage on Pi’s SD card Verify that Pi and PC (that photos are uploaded to) contain sufficient storage for the experiment’s duration Verify that camera is connected, centered, and focused If images are automatically uploaded, verify that Pis are connected to Wifi and synced to upload directory 5. Load insects: Add insects (5-10/cage) Write and save a README.txt file with experiment information into directory that images are uploaded into 6. Start experiment 7. Check-in: Verify images uploaded Verify that light transitions occurred at expected times Verify that SD card contains appropriate storage space for the experiment’s duration 8. End experiment 9. Store data: Sometimes, Wifi interruptions can prevent successful image upload. Verify that no images are missing from any Pis Directly download any outstanding images from Pis Save images in directory for analysis 10. Identify movements by post-process image segmentation 11.
