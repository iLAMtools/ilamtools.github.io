# Raspberry Pi Zero W/Camera Setup
  Steps to program the Raspberry Pi Zero computers to capture and store images:  

**1. Obtain necessary cables/connectors:**

  - USB 2.0 to microSD card reader (to image SD card on a PC)
  - USB 2.0 microUSB male to USB female adapter (to connect keyboard with Pi)
  - Keyboard with USB 2.0 wire
  - Micro HDMI male to HDMI female adapter & HDMI cable (to connect monitor with Pi) or micro HDMI to HDMI cable
  
  
**2. Install operating system:**

```{r aa, fig.cap='Raspberry Pi Imager', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/raspberry_pi_imager.png")
```


  - Use microSD card reader to mount SD card onto a PC
  - Download and open [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
    - Choose OS → Raspberry Pi OS (Other) → Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)
    - Choose Storage  → *Drive referring to microSD card*
    - *Optional*: Gears →
      - Set hostname (*name of the pi on your wifi network that you ssh [pi_name]@[IP Address] into*)
      - Enable ssh
      - Set username and password (*user login information to access the pi*)
      - Set locale settings (*e.g., America/New York & us*)
    - Write
  - Disconnect and insert formatted microSD card into Pi
  - Connect Pi to keyboard, monitor, and power source
  - Once connected to power, Pi automatically turns on

**2. Login with default or already specified login information:**

  - raspberrypi login: pi
  - password: raspberry   

**3. Configure Pi settings:** ```sudo raspi-config```

  - Use arrow keys and Enter to navigate
  - 1 → S1  Connect to wifi  
    - SSID: wifi network name
    - Passphrase: wifi password
  - 1 → S3  change pi password
  - 1 → S4  change pi name (not login)
  - 3 → I1  enable camera attachment
  - 3 → I2  enable remote access (```ssh```)
  - 5 → L2  set timezone
  - Finish (type ```y``` when asked if you want to reboot)

**4. Add static IP address for remote access:**
  https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/set-up-static-ip-address

**5. Continue programming directly or remotely access the Pi through terminal from another PC:**

```
ssh login_name@[IP address]
password:
```
  
**6. Make a folder/directory named 'still' to hold images: **
```mkdir still_[xxx]```
*Note: [xxx] refers to the login name of the Raspberry Pi associated with the iLAM*

**7. Make a directory named script to hold scripts: **
```mkdir script_[xxx]``` 
  
**8. Write a script using a text-editor (e.g., nano) named still_[xxx].sh:**
  ```sudo nano ./script_[xxx]/still_[xxx].sh``` and write the following text:
  
```
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +"%m%d.%H%M")
sudo raspistill -o /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg
```
 - This script will take images and save them along w/ metadata into the still_$USER directory: (1) necessary part of any bash file with instructions, (2) how to format the date and time in the file name, (3) command for pi to take a photo and store it with specified file name/location. 
  - Hit ```control^X``` to exit (type ```y``` when asked if you want to save)

**9. To automatically upload/copy images into a remote directory, (a) upload each image after it's taken, or (b) mount a remote directory.**

  - ```ssh-keygen``` and ```ENTER``` to generate a key so script can automatically upload images without needing a password
  - ```ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa [remote_PC_hostname]@[remote_PC IP address]```
  - Input password for remote_PC
  - a. Add following line to the still_[xxx].sh
    - ```nano ./script_[xxx]/still_[xxx].sh```
    - ```scp /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg [remote_PC_hostname]@[remote_PC IP address]:[directory that you want images saved into]/```

  - b. If mounting Raspberry Pi Zero W images into a remote directory, then repeat the same steps for mount_[xxx].sh:**
        ```
        #!/bin/bash
        DATE=$(date +"%m%d.%H%M")
        sleep 10s
        cp /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg /home/$USER/mount_$USER/
        ```
        
**10. Schedule the imaging script to run periodically with crontab:**

  - Access the crontab file
```
sudo crontab -e
```
  - Select first option to edit the crontab in nano
  - Copy the following to the bottom of the file:
```
*/2 *  *   *   * sh /home/$USER/script_$USER/still_$USER.sh 2>&1
```
  This tells the pi to execute the still.sh file every 2 minutes 
  (the order is minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week). When setting up a new crontab, always run it past [*crontab.guru*](https://crontab.guru/)!
  
  - ```control^X``` to exit (type y when asked if you want to save)
  - If you are mounting to a remote directory [9a], you will also want to add this line
```
#if mounting files to a remote directory, add this line which copies (uploads) the still file from your pi to a remote database
*/2 *  *   *   * sh /home/$USER/script_$USER/mount_$USER.sh 
```

**Accessing Raspberry Pi image files on your PC:**

  - Log in to the linux/powershell on your laptop
  - Run the following command from the computer that you want to download images onto
  ```scp pi@[IP]:~/still_[xxx]/*.jpg ~/Desktop```

**Trouble-shooting**
  - raspistill will not take a picture and returns** ```*failed to open vchiq instance```:
    1. Verify that the camera is connected and the ribbon cable is not damaged:
      ```vcgencmd get_camera```
    2. Determine if the camera or the still_[xxx].sh script is the issue:
      ```raspistill -o /home/$USER/test.jpg```
    3. Modify permissions of the camera:
      ```sudo chmod777 /dev/vchiq```

A Linux reader is required to read the Raspian imaged SD card, when plugged into a Windows PC. [Linux Reader](https://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/) is a free option. Instructions can be found [here](https://raspberrytips.com/read-raspberry-pi-sd-card-windows/).

  **Tips:**
  
- Useful Linux commands:

  - \*				wildcard (e.g. `*.jpg` == all jpeg files)
  - ```control^A``` 		bring cursor to beginning of line
  - ```control^E```		bring cursor to end of line
  - ```control^C```		kill process
  - ```clear``` 			clear all previous text from terminal
  - ```ls```  			list all contents in current folder
  - ```cd directory_path```  	change to named folder
  - ```cd ~```			go to home directory
  - ```cd ..``` 			go up one folder level
  - ```cd -```  			go back to last folder
  - ```mkdir dir_name```  	create EMPTY folder (directory)
  - ```rmdir dir_name```  	remove EMPTY folder
  - ```rm file_name```  		remove a file
  - ```rm -f file_name```  	remove a file without asking for permission
  - ```rm -r dir_name```  	recursively remove all files from folder
  - ```rm -rf dir_name```  	forcefully remove all files from folder
  - ```ren name_1 name_2``` 	rename something to something else
  - ```cp file_1 file_2```  	copy file_1 to file_2, creates duplicate. *note*: if file_2 exists will overwrite (NO warning)
  - ```cp -r dir_1 dir_2``` 	copy folder and its contents
  - ```nano file_name```  	make named file and open text editor
  - ```sudo reboot		reboot pi``` 
  - ```sudo shutdown now```	safely shutdown pi (reboots when plugged in again)
